# Java example to detect drug
You need to install dependencies with "mvn clean install" before using this example.

See the Java class example. It will create a "IndexUniqueTokens" folder (a Lucene index for typo detection) and a "typoFile.csv" that stores typoDetection. 
To improve the RomediTerminology you can send me this CSV file. 

Delete logback.xml in others projects to modify the logs.
